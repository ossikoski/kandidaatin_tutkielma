abstract = {A 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach is used to investigate the effect of parameters such as bottle geometry, surface tension, or inclination on bottle emptying processes. The method can e.g. be used to assess changes of bottle emptying times induced by new bottle shapes, and it is shown to be much more accurate than existing empirical models. While expensive commercial CFD software has substantially restricted and hindered the use of this method in the past, our approach is based on freely available open source CFD software and hence accessible to everyone. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

@techreport{Huang2020,
abstract = {Pouring is one of the most commonly executed tasks in humans' daily lives, whose accuracy is affected by multiple factors, including the type of material to be poured and the geometry of the source and receiving containers. In this work, we propose a self-supervised learning approach that learns the pouring dynamics, pouring motion, and outcomes from unsupervised demonstrations for accurate pouring. The learned pouring model is then generalized by self-supervised practicing to different conditions such as using unaccustomed pouring cups. We have evaluated the proposed approach first with one container from the training set and four new but similar containers. The proposed approach achieved better pouring accuracy than a regular human with a similar pouring speed for all five cups. Both the accuracy and pouring speed outperform state-of-the-art works. We have also evaluated the proposed self-supervised generalization approach using unaccustomed containers that are far different from the ones in the training set. The self-supervised generalization reduces the pouring error of the unaccustomed containers to the desired accuracy level.},

abstract = {The MotoTraining station for teaching and demo. The MotoTraining station is a complete arrangement for training and demonstrating a MOTOMAN robot. The station has a table top with a magnetic whiteboard surface which you can use e.g. to mark positions for your training program. When folded up it can pass through a regular doorway. It is also easy to push into place and connect to a three phase 400V AC outlet. When approaching the station the scanner under the table will fi rst make the robot enter slow speed, and nearer to the station the robot stops completely. Our "You Teach Me" robot is ideal for introducing the MOTOMAN robot and its programming to students and robot operators. Key benefi ts • Easy to operate. • Short delivery times. • Small size suitable for an offi ce or class room. Scope of delivery • MOTOMAN-GP8 robot with YRC1000 controller. • Gripper tool, miniature pallets and blocks. • Small compressor 6 bar with 230V cable. • CEE socket for 400V. • Complete station on wheels. • Light beacon and scanner.},
